        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Black-eyed peas and three kinds of 
            pork are used in this recipe. How 
            can that not bring good fortune? This is my variation of Hoppin' John, which is black-eyed peas, rice, and pork stewed together, usually served with some kind of greens and cornbread.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place black-eyed peas into a 
                    large container and cover with several 
                    inches of cool water; let stand, 8 
                    hours to overnight. Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook pork neck bones and bacon in a Dutch oven 
                    over medium heat until lightly browned, 
                    about 5 minutes. Add onion, celery, and carrot; 
                    cook and stir until softened, 6 to 7 minutes. 
                    Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour cold water and black-eyed peas into pork 
                    mixture; increase heat to high. Stir in bay 
                    leaf, thyme, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne 
                    pepper; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, 
                    cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in tomatoes with green chile peppers 
                    and salt. Simmer uncovered until beans are 
                    tender, about 40 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove neck bones; separate any meat from 
                    bones, return meat to the Dutch oven, and 
                    discard bones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in diced ham and kale; cook until 
                    greens are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                    Serve over rice.
                </li>
