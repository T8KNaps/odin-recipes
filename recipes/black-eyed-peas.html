        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Black-eyed peas and three kinds of 
            pork are used in this recipe. How 
            can that not bring good fortune? This is my variation of Hoppin' John, which is black-eyed peas, rice, and pork stewed together, usually served with some kind of greens and cornbread.
