        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I couldn't find a recipe I liked, so here is my family's version of 
            'curried' chicken. It brings back memories of a childhood spent 
            enjoying food there, where there were very few dishes I wouldn't eat, 
            vegetables or not. This dish is traditionally served on white rice or 
            in a roti, but feel free to get creative!</p>
