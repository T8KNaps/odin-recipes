        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I couldn't find a recipe I liked, so here is my family's version of 
            'curried' chicken. It brings back memories of a childhood spent 
            enjoying food there, where there were very few dishes I wouldn't eat, 
            vegetables or not. This dish is traditionally served on white rice or 
            in a roti, but feel free to get creative!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup curry powder, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>                    
                <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>                    
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>    
                <li>1 sprig fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>    
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 ¼ pounds whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>   
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>    
                <li>3 cups water</li>    
                <li>1 potato, diced</li>    
                <li> ½ cup chopped carrots</li>    
                <li>2 scallions (green onions), chopped</li>    
                <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, minced</li>
                <li>1 Scotch bonnet chile pepper, chopped, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk 2 tablespoons curry powder, garlic powder, 
                    seasoned salt, onion powder, salt, thyme leaves, allspice, 
                    salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Add chicken and coat 
                    with curry mixture until curry mixture is wet and sticks 
                    to chicken.</li>
                <li>Heat oil and 2 tablespoons curry powder in a large cast-iron 
                    skillet over high heat until oil is hot and curry powder changes 
                    color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken to the hot oil mixture and 
                    reduce heat to medium. Add water, potato, carrots, scallions, ginger, 
                    and chile pepper to skillet.</li>
                <li>Cover skillet and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center 
                    and gravy is thickened, allowing chicken to cook undisturbed for last 
                    15 minutes of cooking, 30 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                    inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 
                    165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a serving dish; continue 
                    simmering gravy, uncovered, to thicken (if needed). Serve chicken with 
                    gravy.</li>
